# Preface {-}

This book is a collection of tutorial from the excellent paper by [@wilson2010].
Instead of just copy pasting the tutorial in a bookdown format, the tutorials have been updated to work with the newest version of the softwares and extended to present other softwares.
**However, this is still a work in progress.**

Do not take anything in this manual as gospel.
